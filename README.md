is organized into one folder per technology structure. The individual folders contain the information and exercises

# Solutions

No solutions are provided. This is intentional. In the future adding solutions may be considered. All exercises
do have solutions, and have been done by the author before being posted as exercises. Exercises are intended to be 
as clear as possible. There is usually very few solutions, which should be relatively obvious from reading documentation
or informing yourself on the topic of the exercise.
