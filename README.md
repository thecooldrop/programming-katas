# Introduction

This repository is a collection of exercises for familiarizing yourself with the Spring and Spring Boot ecosystem.
The exercises are designed to familiarize yourself with individual features of Spring and Spring Boot.
Solutions are not provided, because the idea is to have you do it yourself.
I ensure you though, that I have checked that each exercises comes with a solution, which you can learn about from official Spring documentation or tutorials.

## 1. Familiarize yourself with Spring Initialzr

Create a new Spring Boot prouject using Spring Initializr.
Inspect what each of the buttons in the Spring Initializr web UI does.
Note there are at least four buttons to play around with.
